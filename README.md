# XlinkKai
This is a simple wrapper around the [Xlink Kai Engine](https://www.teamxlink.co.uk/).

# Setup
* Burn the sdcard with the latest [firmware](https://github.com/ConnorRigby/xlink-kai/releases/download/v0.1.0/xlink-rpi3-v0.1.0.img).
* Open the fat32 boot partition.
* Input your network settings.
* Insert sdcard in raspberry pi 3.
* Wait for connect.
* Connect to raspberry pi ip address port 80.

# Troubleshooting

## rpi3 never connects?
You probably typed the SSID or psk in wrong.

## something else is broken
  * ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

Anything bad that happens to you is not my fault.
